        <h2> Cultural Capital Posters | Fall 2015</h2>
        
        <h3> Task: <br> Design a social awareness poster, with a focus on college campuses.
        </h3>

<h3> At the time, I was taking my college seminar - a class about minority experiences in American education - where we were assigned to read <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B39QOsm78N4pcFUtQjhTX3NVZXM/edit"><links> "Whose culture has capital? A critical race theory discussion of community cultural wealth."</links></a>  by Tara J. Yosso. In the article, Yosso speaks of six different types of capital that students possess and teachers should use to frame their interactions with them. The six are Familial Capital, Aspirational Capital, Navigational Capital, Linguistic Capital, Social Capital, and Resistance Capital. A few weeks later, I went back home to Mexico and realized I had no idea how the public bus system worked. If I had to get from one place to another without a car, I don't know that I could do it. I started to think more and more about the types of capital that I, or people I know, possess and realized there is so much in people that goes undervalued and taken for granted. There is so much one gains from their daily conditions and experiences. For example, you're probably are much more perseverant and have a higher sense of self-worth if you've had to endure a lot before; you have resistance capital. Or, if you've had to move around a lot and have struggled to find your place, you probably have more navigational capital than you realize. If you have high hopes for the future and can't afford to give up on it, you may have high aspirational capital.
    <br>
    So, I wanted to make posters that would encourage teachers and professors to realize their students full worth by considering all aspects of capital, and in this way, create better and stronger student-teacher relations. I consulted both my college seminar professor, Professor McKenna, and my VCD instructor, Ricky Colon, to achieve the best results. Professor McKenna helped me deliver the correct message and think of ways that might make the poster series more thought provoking for teachers, while Ricky helped me make sure the poster made sense, was not cluttered, looked nice, etc. Ideally, these posters would be hung up in teacher lounges and places of that nature.
